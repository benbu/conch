## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Set up Firebase project** - Create project, enable services, configure
2. **Install dependencies** - Add Firebase SDK, state management, required libraries
3. **Implement authentication** - Login/signup screens and auth flow
4. **Build basic navigation** - Set up proper screen structure
5. **Create first screen** - Conversation list with mock data

Once these are complete, the foundation will be in place to build out the full messaging core.
