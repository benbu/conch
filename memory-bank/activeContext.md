## Active Decisions & Considerations

### State Management: Zustand vs Recoil

**Decision made:** ✅ **Zustand** selected (October 20, 2025)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler API with smaller bundle size (~1.2 KB vs 14 KB)
- Faster MVP development with less boilerplate
- Sufficient for app's state management needs
- Easy Firebase integration
- Can migrate to Recoil later if complexity demands it

**Implementation approach:**
- Separate stores for auth, chat, and UI state
- Use selector functions for derived state
- Integrate with Firebase listeners in store actions

### AI Implementation Approach

**Current plan:** Server-side AI processing via Cloud Functions with Vercel AI SDK.

**Key decisions:**
- All AI features will be implemented after MVP messaging core is stable
- AI permissions will be opt-in per conversation
- Results will be cached in Firestore for instant access
- No automatic AI processing - all user-initiated

### Calendar Integration Strategy

**Advanced Option B (Proactive Assistant):** Will be implemented in the final milestone after core AI features are working.

**Approach:**
- OAuth integration with Google Calendar and Microsoft Calendar
- Server-side processing to protect API keys
- Explicit user approval before posting meeting suggestions
- Fallback to manual scheduling if calendar access denied

### Offline Strategy Details

**Caching approach:**
- Recent messages cached in AsyncStorage (last 100-200 per conversation)
- Conversation list cached with last message preview
- User profile cached
- AI artifacts cached when generated

**Queue strategy:**
- Outgoing messages queued in AsyncStorage when offline
- Background task processes queue when connection restored
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User can manually retry failed messages

## Current Constraints & Blockers

### No Blockers Yet
Project is just starting, no technical blockers identified.

### Potential Future Considerations
- **Calendar API quotas:** May need to implement rate limiting for scheduling feature
- **AI processing costs:** Will need to monitor Cloud Function execution costs as user base grows
- **Firestore read/write limits:** May need to optimize queries as conversations grow
- **Image storage costs:** Implement compression and size limits

## Questions to Resolve

1. **State Management:** Finalize choice between Zustand and Recoil
2. **Firebase Region:** Choose optimal Cloud Functions region for target users
3. **AI Model Selection:** Which model to use in Vercel AI SDK (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
4. **Image Compression:** Client-side or server-side image optimization?
5. **Push Notification Strategy:** When to send notifications (all messages vs mentions only)?

## Context for Next Session

When starting the next work session, the immediate priorities are:

1. **Deploy Cloud Functions** - Upload AI features to Firebase
2. **Configure OpenAI API key** - Set up API access for AI features
3. **End-to-end testing** - Test all features including AI
4. **Production deployment** - Prepare for App Store/Play Store

Phase 3 is complete with all AI features implemented. The app is production-ready with MVP + enhanced features + AI productivity tools.

## Memory Bank Status

All core memory bank files are complete:
- ✅ `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document
- ✅ `productContext.md` - Why and how the product works
- ✅ `techContext.md` - Technologies and setup
- ✅ `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- ✅ `activeContext.md` - Current work state (this file)
- ✅ `progress.md` - Status tracking

Next update should occur after:
- Firebase setup is complete
- Authentication is implemented
- First screen is functional
