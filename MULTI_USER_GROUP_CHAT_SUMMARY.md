## Data Structure

### Firestore Conversation Document
```javascript
{
  id: "conv123",
  name: "Project Team",  // Custom group name
  title: null,  // Legacy field
  type: "group",
  participantIds: ["user1", "user2", "user3"],  // For queries
  members: [
    {
      userId: "user1",
      role: "admin",
      joinedAt: Timestamp
    },
    {
      userId: "user2",
      role: "team",
      joinedAt: Timestamp
    },
    {
      userId: "user3",
      role: "user",
      joinedAt: Timestamp
    }
  ],
  createdBy: "user1",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastMessageAt: Timestamp,
  lastMessage: { ... }
}
```

## Security

### Firestore Security Rules
Comprehensive security rules documented in `FIRESTORE_GROUP_CHAT_RULES.md`:
- Role-based access control
- Admins can update names and manage roles
- Team can add members
- All members can send messages
- Members can remove themselves
- Non-participants cannot access conversations

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Last Admin Protection**: Last admin cannot leave until promoting another member
2. **Role Validation**: Server validates role changes based on current user's role
3. **Minimum Participants**: Groups require ≥3 total participants (2+ others)
4. **Empty Group Names**: Falls back to auto-generated name from members
5. **Direct → Group Conversion**: Not implemented (would require adding 3rd person)
6. **Duplicate Users**: Multi-select prevents selecting same user twice

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create group with 2+ users
- [ ] Group name appears in conversation list
- [ ] Overlapping avatars show in list and header
- [ ] Admin can edit group name
- [ ] Admin can promote user to team/admin
- [ ] Admin can remove members
- [ ] Team can add members but not change roles
- [ ] User can only leave group
- [ ] Last admin cannot leave
- [ ] Member count updates correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates across all clients
- [ ] Security rules prevent unauthorized access

## Important Implementation Notes

### Firestore Timestamp Handling

Firestore's `serverTimestamp()` cannot be used inside arrays. For the `members` array, we use `new Date()` instead:

```javascript
// In createConversation and addMemberToConversation
const members = participantIds.map((userId) => ({
  userId,
  role: userId === createdBy ? 'admin' : 'user',
  joinedAt: new Date(), // ✅ Works in arrays
}));
```

This is a Firestore limitation, not a code issue. The top-level `createdAt` and `lastMessageAt` fields still use `serverTimestamp()` for server-side consistency.

## Known Limitations

1. **Add Members Search**: Currently shows alert, needs implementation
2. **Direct to Group Conversion**: Not implemented (would need to handle adding 3rd person to existing direct chat)
3. **Role History**: No audit log of role changes
4. **Kick vs Leave**: No distinction in UI between being removed vs leaving
5. **Group Avatar**: Uses text avatars, could be enhanced with group photo upload

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Members Implementation**: Full user search modal within member management
2. **Group Photos**: Upload custom group avatar
3. **Role Permissions Customization**: Allow admins to define custom permission sets
4. **Member Kick Notifications**: Notify users when removed from group
5. **Audit Log**: Track member additions, removals, and role changes
6. **Message Reactions**: Group-specific reaction features
7. **@Mentions**: Mention specific members in group chats
8. **Group Description**: Add optional group description field
9. **Join Links**: Generate invite links for groups
10. **Group Settings**: Advanced settings screen with more options
