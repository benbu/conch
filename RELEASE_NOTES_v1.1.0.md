## 🎉 What's New in v1.1.0

### Unified Search Experience

We've completely reimagined the search experience! The "Discover" tab is now "Search" - a powerful unified search that finds both people and messages across all your conversations.

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 **Instant Local Search**: Results appear as you type, no waiting
- 🌐 **Intelligent Deeper Search**: When results are limited, search the entire database with one tap
- 📂 **Organized Results**: Clear sections for People and Messages
- 💬 **Message Context**: See conversation name, message preview, and timestamp
- 🎯 **Smart Navigation**: Jump directly to any message in any conversation

### Quick Access to AI Settings

AI Settings are now easier to find! Access all your AI feature controls directly from your Profile.

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ One tap from Profile to AI Settings
- ✨ Clear visual indicator with sparkles emoji
- 🎨 Consistent with other settings patterns

### Scroll-to-Message Navigation

Found a message in search? We'll take you right to it!

**How it Works:**
1. Search for a message
2. Tap the result
3. Chat opens and automatically scrolls to that exact message
4. Message highlights briefly so you know you're in the right place
